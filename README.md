# Fruit-Classification
Classification of fruits is traditionally done using manual resources due to which the time and economic involvements increase adversely with number of fruit types and items
per class. In recent times computer based auto‚Äêmated techniques have been used to alleviate this problem to a certain extent. In This Project I use decision tree classifier and naive Bayes algorithm, svm methodologies to classify fruits based on their visual features like mass, height, width, and color. However, challenges of such techniques include the fact that fruit appearances differ due to natural environments, geographical locations, stages of growth, size, orientations and imaging equipments.The best advantage of this decision tree classifier is producing a comprehensible classification/regression model and satisfactory accuracy levels in several application domains, such as fruit classification. For some types of probability models, naive Bayes classifiers can be trained very efficiently in a supervised learning setting. In this paper, a visual feature based fruit classification approach has been proposed which is independent of many of these factors. The proposed method has been implemented using 59 subtype of 4 main fruits type.

# ALGORITHMS
**DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER**<br/>
A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature (or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value.<br/>
**NAIVE BAYES**<br/>
In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter.<br/>
**SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE**<br/>
In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular
coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very.
